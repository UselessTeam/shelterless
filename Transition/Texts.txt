How's it going adventurer? Nice to have company on this long travel!
You're doing the silent bodygard thing, heh? Suit yourself I guess.
....
Damn it! A rock is blocking the path.
I suppose you'll manage to break it with that big hammer of yours?

That rock didn't stand a chance.
Oh crap! The noise attracted a monster!
Time to earn your pay! I'll be hiding over here. Nothing you can't handle I suppose?

Impressive, you do know how to hit hard!
But you should be careful! Sometimes it's better to let mother nature de the dirty work.
Monsters sure are immune to poison, but fire will make quick work of them!
Look another lonely monster overthere, why don't you try pushing it into a fire pit?

Nicely done! Althouth the screams of agony he shouted as he was being scorched alive will do us no good!
Let's get out of here!
Just in case, take this.
These are fire grenades! Just throw one and you'll light a whole pool of poison on fire!
OH CRAP OH CRAP! SOme monsters managed to find us!
Time to make yourself useful!

That was a close call! Thanks for your help back there!
OH NO! Even MOOOOORE monsters! 
Let's waste no time! Here is another one of my precious wares.
It's a wind grenade. Throw it somewhere, and it will push away all monsters around it!
Be ready for the final battle!

Lvl 5-end
Great work back there! I think we finally got away from them...
Look, we can see our destination in the distance!
Thanks for everything. Hope to see you again for more adventures!
